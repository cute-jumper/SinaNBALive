* Sina NBA Live Indicator
** Overview
This is an ubuntu indicator for the Sina NBA Live service.
** Get Started
Open a terminal and type:
: python SinaNBALive-indicator.py

Enjoy yourself!
** Future Work
This script does not use PyGTK. Instead, it uses GTK+3 through the PyGObject
bindings. It seems there are some bugs which make me unable to modify some user
interface for the menu item. In the future, I will focus on improving the GUI if
I have time because I think the basic functions of this indicator are quite
simple and have been almost implemented in current version.
